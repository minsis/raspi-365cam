Python script to trigger a picture on the Raspberry Pi and transfers
that file to a given server.

Adding light sensor to detect the amount of light in the room or outside
and trigger the shutter speed and exposure accordingly.

The point of this project was to learn a little bit of python, linux,
and git. However, this script could be useful to someone who wants
to do a 365 project with their Raspberry Pi camera.
